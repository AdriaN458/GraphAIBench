There are different categories of graph algorithms: 

(1) Graph analytics, e.g., PageRank (link analysis), SSSP, BFS, betweenness centrality, connected components. 
They are know as [vertex programs](https://shawnliu.me/post/vertex-centric-graph-processing-the-what-and-why/);

(2) Graph pattern mining (GPM), e.g., triangle counting, k-clique listing, motif counting, graph querying, frequent subgraph mining;

(3) Graph machine learning (GML), e.g., graph embedding, graph neural networks, collaborative filtering, link prediction;

(4) Graph sampling, e.g., random walk, neighbor sampling, subgraph sampling, layer-wise sampling, etc.

(5) Graph manipulation: graph construction/generation, graph partitioning, graph coarsening.

(6) Graph clustering: Louvain algorithm.

(7) Graph filtering: Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph (TMFG), Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), Planar Maximally Filtered Graph (PMFG).

(8) Streaming/dynamic graphs: vertex/edge insertion/deletion, B-tree, C-tree, Packed Memory Array (PMA).
