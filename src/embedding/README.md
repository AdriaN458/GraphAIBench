Graph Emebdding, a shallow approach for graph machine learning or graph representation learning.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) based parallel algorithm for graph representation learning.

*** Collaborative Filtering (Matrix Factorization) ***

The algorithm is described in the paper "GraphMat: High performance graph analytics made productive", VLDB 2015
(https://github.com/narayanan2004/GraphMat/blob/master/src/SGD.cpp)
